I wrote up some of the whys, [hows and results of the load balancing improvements](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-edge-load-balancing-695308b5548c) I've been working on recently on Edge systems at Netflix.

I tried to include some of the overarching principles that we used when designing the system, as well as the real-world operational impact once it was in prod.

Hopefully others in the load balancing/service mesh/IPC space will find it interesting or at least gain some useful new data-points.
