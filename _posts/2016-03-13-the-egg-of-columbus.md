When you're weighing solutions to a problem, remember to also consider the effect of removing or relaxing requirements and constraints.


## Beware of Implied Constraints

The parable of [The Egg of Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_of_Columbus) always stuck in my mind since I was first told it as a child, and I see multiple lessons that can be taken from it. 
Columbus challenges the Spanish Nobles to stand an Egg on it's tip, and they all fail because they assume an implicit constraint that the egg should not be damaged.

I find this useful to bare in mind in engineering, as we often assume implied constraints on how we should design and build systems. These constraints then lead to unnecessarily complicated solutions.

Stand back and consider what implied constraints you're applying, and whether they're actually valid. Sometimes they are, sometimes they aren't.

### Cheating?

The first time I remember using this, was when in my early teens, I was in a school-sponsored engineering contest. One of the problems the teams were given was to build a lego truck that was able to carry some steel bars down a steep slope, crash into a barrier at the bottom, and survive without any bars spilling.

All the other teams focused on making their trucks as strong and stable as possible, so that it would survive the collision.

Our team just jerry-rigged brakes for the wheels, and won the prize.


## Requirements are rarely all set in stone

Once you've spent some time analyzing solutions for a problem, you'll often have insights that the originator's of the requirements did not. So if you think that removal or weakening of a requirement will reduce the cost or risk, than have confidence and try it.

eg. One requirement is 10% of the value, but is the highest risk due to it being a new area of development, and therefore the estimate is in an uncertain range of 20-60% of the total effort. Is it worth slowing the rollout of the rest of the value, or even the potential for a cancelled project, for this one requirement?

When looking at solutions to a problem, try to step back and see the choice in terms of the _best combination of value, cost and risk_. Engineers should take some responsibility for the balancing of these 3 - it shouldn't just be left up to management.

Or as President Underwood would say, "If you donâ€™t like how the table is set, turn over the table".
