> "He who strains after the gnat of perfection will swallow the camel of unreadiness!" 
<small> -- <cite>[Lord Fisher of Kilverstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fisher,_1st_Baron_Fisher) (First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy 1904-10)</cite></small>

This quote was on the wall of one of my fathers' managers during his years as an Engineering Manager at what was then British Steel Corporation. And it - and other 'war stories' he told me as a youngter turned out to make a big impression on me.


## Solving Problems Under Pressure _<small>Paraphrasing egregiously</small>_

 My Dad was responsible for transport at the Steel Works (trains and trucks carrying large cargoes of iron and steel around the site). In this incident, some consultants had been brought in to design and lay a new road for transporting steel beams between 2 plants. And just a week after the new road was put to use, it had started to _liquify_ (ie. the vast weight of the loaded trucks was causing the foundations of the road to move).

The Chief Engineer and others were speculating about what to do - closing the road for repairs would cost millions, and no-one was certain what to do to fix it. Spending weeks more to find the best solution was the _no-one-gets-fired-for-buying-ibm solution_, but would be extremely costly. And no-one wanted to take responsibility for making a decision that might loook badly on them if it failed.

At this point my Dad got involved:

1. He used his engineering knowledge to propose how _he_ would build a road like this that needs to support massive forces. Basically - deeper foundations starting with layers of decreasingly coarse fill.
2. Time costs far more than materials in this situation, so keep it simple, but don't try to make it perfectly efficient - use large rocks, and deeper foundations than might actually be required.
3. He stood up and took responsibility for the plan he was suggesting. In front of superiors and peers, he transparently explained what and why he would do this, and took responsibility on his own shoulders.


### What I took away from this

* Trust your own judgement. And demonstrate this to others by taking responsibility for the outcome.
* Fast turnaround often outweighs perfection.
* Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
