_blurb about the egg of columbus story, with quote and link to wikipedia article__.

The usual metaphor taken from this story is:
_When something is shown to you it becomes easy_

and also:
_The hard part is to be the first to do something_

But for the sake of the point I'm trying to make in this post, I'm going to focus on another lesson that I think you can take from it: 
_Beware of you're own self-imposed constraints in solving a problem_?
_Don't just accept the implicit constraints of a problem_?

- Point: Sometimes the most effective way to solve a problem is to redefine the problem itself.
- When you have a hard problem to solve, as well as just looking at possible solutions, also realize you can:
  - Consider which constraints are hard, and which are soft (or artificial). Removing artificial constraints often opens the problem up to simpler/faster solutions.
  - Consider if the problem itself can be changed, or split into high-value & lower difficulty plus lower-value & higher difficulty. Sometimes it's the combination of goals that makes a problem difficult.
    - Or as President Underwood would say, "If you donâ€™t like how the table is set, turn over the table".
  - Need examples of each of these.
- Engineering contest when I was a kid - how I removed the artificial constraints (others might call cheating). -- (1)
