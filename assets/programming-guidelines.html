        <h3>Refactoring</h3>
        <p>The purpose of refactoring is to improve the maintainability of a program,
        without making any functional changes to it. So, the program should behave
        exactly the same before the refactoring as after.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To improve the maintainability of the code, concentrate on:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Removing duplication</strong>.</li>
              <li>Improving readability.</li>
              <li>Increasing consistency (of method/class/variable naming, for
              example).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Make one unit-of-change at a time. Test after each one (or a few - not more
          than 1/2 hour). Then commit to CVS (so you have a useful history in case you
          need to rollback), and add a useful commit-comment, even if it's just
          "Refactoring".</li>
          <li>Naming of methods and classes is very important, but at the same time, very
          easy to change (using the IDE-refactoring-tools). Name a method what you think
          it does (a verb). If you later change your mind, don't consider changing it,
          <em>just change it</em>. Name classes what they represent (a noun). Don't worry
          about the names being too long, and don't abbreviate them unless it's really
          necessary or obvious what the abbreviation means.</li>
          <li>Start by breaking up large methods into smaller ones that <em>only do one
          thing</em> - then name them that thing.</li>
          <li>Delete anything (variables,classes,methods) that isn't being used. If you
          ever need it again, it'll be in CVS, so no problem. This stops you from having
          to waste time updating old code that is not even used. It also makes the
          program easier to understand.</li>
          <li>When refactoring, don't think/worry about the <em>Design</em>. For example;
          If you want to pull one method out of 2 classes into a new class (that does
          nothing except this one method), then just do it. This new class will probably
          flesh out in future refactorings anyhow (or you'll push it back into a more
          suitable class).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>OO</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In general, the methods of a class should operate upon that class's own
          members. If you find that you are passing a lot of parameters to the methods of
          a class, then consider declaring these as member variables, and assigning them
          in the constructor (or some kind of <code>initialise()</code> method).</li>
          <li>
            If you're often passing around lists or maps of objects, consider writing a
            simple class to represent that list/map of objects. Create
            <code>add<em>Object</em>()</code> or <code>put<em>Object</em>()</code>
            methods that control the type of objects added to the collection. This gives
            you some nice type-safety, and also often turns into a good place to put
            convenience/helper methods that act on the objects in the collection.

        <h3>Web/Servlets</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>HTTP Caching</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Implement/override the <a
                href="/docs/servlet-2.4/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html#getLastModified(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)">
                <code>getLastModified()</code></a> method in servlets whenever possible.
                This is particularly simple for pages whose last-modified date is
                dependent on just one (or a few) files, because you can just return the
                date of the file.</p>
                <p>The advantage of doing this is that the browser will use it's cached
                page if it hasn't been modified since it was cached.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a
                  href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.29">Last-Modified
                  Response Header - Servlet Container uses <code>getLastModified()</code>
                  to set this</a></li>
                  <li><a
                  href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.25">If-Modified-Since
                  Request Header - Used by the browser</a></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Set the HTTP <a
                href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.21">Expires</a>
                or <a
                href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9">Cache-Control,
                max-age</a> header. For static files or pages which don't change, for
                example, css and images.</p>
                <p>This is easy to do on the website. You just have to configure Apache
                to serve your static files, and then you can set an Expires value for
                those files. It's generally best not to set it to more than 24 hours.</p>
                <p>By setting the Expires/max-age headers, you are telling the browser
                that it can cache and re-use the page for that length of time, without
                making any further requests to the server. This can noticeably improve
                the speed of page-loading.</p>

              This book explains HTTP pretty well.</a></li>
              <li>
                <p>To help understand/find what http-headers are being sent back and
                forth between browser and server, try installing this <a
                href="http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/">plugin for mozilla</a>.
                Alternatively, use <code>curl --include &lt;URL&gt;</code> or <code>curl
                --head &lt;URL&gt;</code> from linux command-line.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Statelessness is Your Friend :)</h4>
            <p>Don't hold state in the Session object. Only use this as a method of
            holding/caching objects to improve performance. An effective way of
            approaching this is to write all your view-code with the assumption that the
            user has requested this page by opening a new browser, and typing in the
            URL.</p>
            <p>An implication of this, is that state (or more likely -
            pointers/referemces/keys to state) should be embedded in the URL's/links you
            generate. You can do this using parameters, <a
            href="http://images.google.com/images?q=pug">http://images.google.com/images?q=pug</a>,
            or by building it into the path-hierarchy of the URL, <a
            href="http://del.icio.us/mjsmithlondon/rest">http://del.icio.us/mjsmithlondon/rest</a></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Authentication/Login is a pragmatic exception to this. You shouldn't
                put passwords or maybe even usernames in the URL for security reasons.
                The alternative of using HTTP-Authentication works, but the UI that
                web-browsers use for it is crap.</p>

          <li>
            <h4>General</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>If you model your webapp as a website (ie. a graph of linked documents)
              rather than a client-server application, the rest of the web infrastructure
              (browsers, proxies) is more likely to work with you, rather than against
              you.</li>
              <li>
                <p>A general rule for when to use GET vs POST - Use POST when the request
                will modify/add/delete something, otherwise use GET.</p>
                <p>Remember that a HTML FORM can be used for GET as well as POST.</p>
              </li>
              <li>When responding to a POST; if the page you are going to return is also
              accessible via GET, then return a <strong>Redirect</strong> pointing to the
              URL of the page. I generally always return a redirect, except for things
              which have no real value within the system (eg. confirmation messages,
              errors, etc..)</li>
              <li>
                Try to use the standard html tags consistently in your webapp. Most users
                will have used a web browser before when navigating around websites. So
                try to use recognizable links for navigation (rather than some other tag
                with javascript attached to the onClick() event).
                <p>See this article for info on <a
                href="http://www.evolt.org/article/Links_and_JavaScript_Living_Together_in_Harmony/17/20938/">
                opening new windows using js, while still having a link with the real
                href.</a></p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Character Encoding</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Probably the safest strategy is to encode everyting as UTF-8.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Set the response content-type to UTF-8 every time you send a
                    response, eg.
<pre>
<code>HttpServletResponse.setContentType("text/html; charset=UTF-8")</code>
</pre>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If serving static html pages (ie. you can't set the response
                    content-type), then add the equivalent meta tag to the html, eg.
<pre>
&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;
</pre>
                    <em>NB. This is one of the few times I would recommend using the META
                    HTTP-EQUIV tag.</em>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Set the character-encoding of the request to UTF-8. You can only be
                    confident that it is this, because all the pages you sent out were
                    UTF-8.
<pre>
<code>HttpServletRequest.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8")</code>
</pre>
                    This tells the servlet-container (tomcat) to assume that all
                    parameters and headers in the request are encoded as UTF-8. Without
                    telling the container this, it will/should check if any
                    character-encoding was set by the browser (none of the browsers seem
                    to bother) and if not, then assume ISO-8859-1 (Latin1).
                    <p><strong>Beware: Tomcat has a bug/feature that
                    setCharacterEncoding() must be called before any client code accesses
                    the request-parameters/headers. (ie once an access has been made to a
                    parameter, tomcat parses all of the parameters using the current
                    character-encoding, and caches them. Therefore, setting the encoding
                    after this will have no effect.). Therefore, recommend setting this
                    at the beginning of your Gateway-type class's service()
                    method.</strong></p>

                <code>&lt;div/&gt;</code>, it messes up most browsers, so you must put a
                space before the end of the tag - <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code>.</p>
                <p>I have encountered problems using even this method sometimes (I think

              <li>
                <p>Beware when including styles or scripts in the <code>HEAD</code>
                element. Because there could be illegal characters in them (eg. &lt;,
                &gt;, &amp;). According to the <a
                href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.8">spec</a> , you need to wrap
                them in <code>CDATA</code> tags.</p>
                <p>But in reality, you also need to comment out the CDATA tags using
                <code>//</code> for styles, and <code>/* */</code> for scripts. More

                INPUT and BUTTON behaviour</a></cite>
                <p>This is mainly a problem when you want to have one form with multiple
                submit buttons. This bug means that you can't use the same name for each
                submit button, then decide what action to take server-side based on the
                value.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Give each submit button a different name,
                but prefixed by the name you really wanted to use. Then base you
                server-side action purely on whether a particular button's name is in the
                parameter list.</p>
                <p><em>NB. IE6 also seems to submit the name/text pairs of
                <strong>all</strong> the submit buttons, rather than just the one that
                was clicked. Therefore recommend not using BUTTON at all. (Note that the
                main reason for using BUTTON was that you can set the display-text to be
                different to the value.)</em></p>
